A simple, classic and somewhat buggy dijkstra's shortest path algorithm 
combined with a graph ADT + a min-heap ADT which I was going to use for 
it, but I guess it was going to be alot harder, since it needed 
modifications. 

Anyways, this is a solution to the "Hack Bulgaria" ANSI C course 
application problem. The contents of the provided LICENCE file are 
applied to all files on this repository - be they executable or source 
files. 

The project should come with a Makefile for compiling the source or, 
in case I actually decide to continue it a configure script which is 
going to create that Makefile. You will most likely need a gcc to 
compile the project, or at least to use the Makefile, although the code 
has no other dependencies, God only knows what can happen. 

Compiling instructions: 
 0. - Type `make` in the top-level directory of the project.
